Rebuild of my personal blog website using all rust based technologies.

## Why am I building my website again?
I wanted a website that I can add reactivity to and I wanted to do it in a language that I enjoy.

## What tools and technologies am I using?
Database: Postgresql
Server: Rocket-rs
FrontEnd: Sycamore-rs
Markdown Converter: markdown-rs
Domain: Porkbun
Hosting Service: Railway

## To Do List:
- [ ] Implement admin login page.
- [ ] Implement single direction encryption for the login. (I understand that its not best practice to roll out my own encryption solution but it is a learning experience)
- [ ] Implement realtime markup converter in the admin panel for submitting blogs.

- [ ] Create an SVG for the page logo.
- [ ] Create an ICO for the page logo.

- [ ] Implement a search bar to fuzzy search the blogs.
- [ ] Implement filters to filter by other terms.
